## How to play

### The game screen
The game screen is divided in two areas: the game scene and the Program Manager Panel.
Your mission is to guide the maintenance robot to all the targets needing repair. 
On each level, a wrong program is presented, and you should fix it in order for the robot to achieve her goal.

### The Program Manager Panel
The right panel shows two columns with actions and a time bar in the bottom.
The current program is defined in the left column, and will always have bugs that will make the robot
malfunctiong and being unable to complete her repair tasks.

The right column has all the available actions to fix the current program.

### Fixing the program
You can swap actions between columns by clicking on one action in the left column and then 
clicking another action on the right column and viceversa. 

You are allowed to swap actions until the time bar is empty.
The robot will then start executing the program.
